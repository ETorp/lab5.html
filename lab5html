    <div> <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi, My name is Erica, I am currently a sophmore studying Graphic Design at Lesley University, located in Cambridge Ma. I have always been a traditional artist, specialising in paints, drawing and fiberarts and I am expanding my skillset into the digital realm to pursue my interests in Graphic Design. I grew up in Burlington Ma, graduated from Burlington High, and played soccer in high school, I was a goalie... I miss it a little bit. My hobbies include but are not limited to crochet, sewing, baking, painting and cooking.

    <div> <h2>Background</h2>
      <p> I was born an artist, I get it from my Grandmother. In her lifetime, she has co founded a bakery, been a painter, a seamstress and worked in cybersecurity. My family jokes that I am her 2.0. She taught me everything I know, how to paint, draw, sew, crochet, cook, bake, and basically everything. </p>
